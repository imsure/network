% First Pass:
% Carefully read abstract, intro, main design, and conclusions.
% Skim analysis/evaluation section.
\section{First Pass}

\emph{Carefully read abstract, intro, main design, and
  conclusions. Skim analysis/evaluation section.}

\subsection{What is the goal?}
Attempts to capture some of the early reasoning which shaped the
Internet protocols.

\subsection{What is the specific problem?}

\subsection{What is the context (background, previous work,
  assumption)?} 

\subsection{What is the main idea of the paper?}

% Second Pass:
% Start with the assumption that the main point is wrong, even if you
% agree with it.
% Focus on analysis/evaluation sections and the details of the design.
% How do the results prove otherwise?
% What are the weak points?
\section{Second Pass}

\emph{Start with the assumption that the main point is wrong, even if
  you agree with it. Focus on analysis/evaluation sections and the
  details of the design. (How do the results prove otherwise?) What
  are the weak points?}

\subsection{How do the results prove otherwise?}
\emph{How do the results prove that my assumption (that the main point
  is wrong) is wrong?}

\subsection{What are the weak points?}
